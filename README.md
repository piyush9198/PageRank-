# PageRank-
PageRank is an algorithm employed by Google Search to rank websites according to the number and quality of links directed to that page. This algorithm assumes that the more important a website, more likely it will receive links from other web pages. The success of Google is due to its ability to successfully deliver accurate results to queries. Numerous variables are considered to calculate the score of a page before listing these results. The objective of this paper is to design, implement and test a multiprocessing parallel estimator for PageRank using OpenMP. We will implement the PageRank method with a random walk to compute on a Stanford large network dataset collection, and provide the concept of this method in shared memory multicore architecture. Additionally, we will compare certain parallel algorithmic concepts such as load balance, distributed vs. shared memory and the data layout of these algorithms.  Keywords: parallel multiprocessing, distributed memory, shared memory, PageRank.
